changes:
  - rscadd: Smooth movable lighting system implemented. Projectiles, sparks, thrown
      flashlights or moving mobs with lights should be much smoother and less laggy.
  - rscadd: Directional lighting is in, applying to certain things like flashlights,
      headlamps, etc.
  - balance: Light sources no longer stack in range, though they still do in intensity.
  - balance: Mechs no longer block sight. It's a non-trivial cost for the lighting
      system with little to no gain.
